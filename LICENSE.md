In other words, use my content! Just make sure you attribute correctly. As a
rule of thumb, if you know how to correctly cite for a scientific paper, you're
definitely fine when applying that methodology to my content.

(note that this is the *content*, i.e. the code processed by LaTeX and to an
extent by pres.pdf; it doesn't built upon either, so it's not GPLv3 by
infection.)

and attribute correctly, I'm fine with that :)
